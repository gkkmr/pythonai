Predict the Housing Price of Boston?
You need to Predict MEDV.

1)First Create a Simple Linear Regression using x='lstat',y='medv'?
2)Create a Multi Linear Regression using all the input variables are x,y='medv'?

Below is the description of the Data

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
